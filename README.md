# Recurrent Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (rFSGS)
Materials associated with the "[Clinical characteristics and favorable treatment responses of recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children after kidney transplantation](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-024-06452-z)" study.


## Phenotype for nephrotic syndrome patients who have received a kidney transplant

Phenotype for identifying a cohort of patients with nephrotic syndrome who have received a kidney transplant, excluding patients who meet criteria for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

To identify a cohort of patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) for a natural history study of recurrent FSGS which included therapy comparisons, a cohort of patients with nephrotic syndrome who received a kidney transplant and do not meet criteria for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) were identified. Chart review was subsequently used to identify patients with FSGS within this cohort.

### Criteria
* ≥3 face-to-face nephrology encounters, separated by ≥7 days
* Meet criteria for glomerular disease cohort
* Meet criteria for nephrotic syndrome subcohort
* Evidence for kidney transplant
* Do not meet criteria for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) computational phenotype
